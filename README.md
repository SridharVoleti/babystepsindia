# Baby Steps Platform

Central identity/entitlement app for `babysteps.in`, per
[REQ-08](./REQ-08-baby-steps-platform-auth.md). Next.js 14 (App Router) +
TypeScript + Tailwind.

**Current runtime mode: local SQLite + built-in session auth**, not
Supabase — see "Local dev mode vs. production" below.

## What's implemented

- Marketing landing page with a live product catalog section
  (`src/lib/products.ts`), linking to each product app's **local dev port**
  in development or its production subdomain otherwise
- Tricolor design system (`tailwind.config.ts`, `src/app/globals.css`) — see
  "Theme" below
- Full password-based auth flow: signup, login, logout, password reset
  (dev-mode: the reset link is shown on-page instead of emailed, since
  there's no email provider locally), protected `/account` page
- **Admin dashboard** (`/admin`, REQ-08 §8): date-range + granularity picker,
  revenue/active-subscriber/growth stat tiles and breakdowns by product,
  manual "grant access" action, and an audit-log view — gated on a per-user
  `is_admin` flag
- SQLite schema (`src/lib/db/schema.sql`) and SQL migrations
  (`supabase/migrations/`) implementing REQ-08 §3 (profiles, products,
  subscriptions, payments, entitlement logic), §7 (audit log), and §8
  (reporting views) — kept in parallel, see below

## Local dev mode vs. production

REQ-08 specifies a single centralized **Supabase** project for auth and
entitlements. Setting that up isn't needed to develop against day to day, so
this app currently runs against a **local SQLite file** and a **built-in
JWT session** (`src/lib/auth/`, `src/lib/db/`) instead:

- `src/lib/db/*` — SQLite queries, same column names/status enums as the
  Postgres schema in `supabase/migrations/`, so porting later is a dialect
  change, not a redesign
- `src/lib/auth/session.ts` — signs a local JWT (`jose`, HS256) with the
  same `entitlements` claim shape as REQ-08 §4.1, stored in an httpOnly
  cookie. No refresh flow (unlike the real 1-hour Supabase JWT + silent
  refresh) — it's just longer-lived for dev convenience
- The `src/lib/supabase/*` client helpers and `supabase/migrations/*.sql`
  are untouched and dormant — that's the production path to switch back to

On first run, a local admin account is seeded (`ADMIN_EMAIL` /
`ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env.local`, printed to the console) and the SQLite
file appears at `./data/babysteps.db` (gitignored).

## Theme

Saffron (`saffron-*`), a modernized green (`green-*` — shifted from the
flag's yellow-olive `#138808` toward a fresher emerald `#10A374` so it reads
as a product accent rather than a literal flag swatch), and an Ashoka Chakra
navy (`chakra-*`) for text/dark surfaces. The three colors only appear
together in the `.tricolor-rule` accent bar (header/footer) — everywhere
else they're used individually (saffron = primary CTA, green = success/
secondary accent, navy = text and dark surfaces) so the site doesn't read as
a literal flag graphic.

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# generate AUTH_SECRET: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
npm run dev
```

Or double-click **`dev.bat`** — it copies `.env.local.example` on first run
if `.env.local` is missing, opens `http://localhost:3000` in your browser,
and starts the dev server.

Log in with the seeded admin (default `admin@babysteps.in` /
`changeme123`, or whatever `.env.local` sets) to reach `/admin`.

### Other product apps' local ports

The product catalog links out to each product app's own dev server, per
[REQ-08 §2](./REQ-08-baby-steps-platform-auth.md) (each product is its own
Vercel+Supabase project). On localhost that's by port, not subdomain:

| Product | Slug | Local port |
|---|---|---|
| ChessQuest | `chess` | 3002 |
| Magical Math | `magical-math` | 8763 |
| Speed Reading | `speed-reading` | 3003 |

Note: cross-app session sharing (the shared `.babysteps.in` cookie domain
in REQ-08 §4.3) doesn't work across different `localhost` ports — different
ports are different origins. That only becomes testable once product apps
are deployed to real subdomains.

## Not yet built (see REQ-08 for spec)

- Razorpay webhook handler (§6)
- Custom access-token hook that embeds `entitlements` into the JWT — only
  relevant once ported to Supabase (§4.1)
- Cross-project JWT verification config on product apps (§4.3, §9)

## Applying the production (Supabase) migrations

Run the files in `supabase/migrations/` in order (`supabase db push` or the
SQL editor) against the Baby Steps Supabase project once it's provisioned,
and swap the auth/db code back onto `src/lib/supabase/*`.
